### Rules of Probability
$$sum \ \ rule: p(X) = \sum_Yp(X,Y) \\ product \ \ rule: p(X,Y) = p(Y\mid X)p(X)$$

其中， $p(X,Y)$为联合概率 ，"X和Y的概率"；<br>
$p(Y\mid X)$为条件概率，"在X给定的条件下， Y的概率"<br>
$p(X)$为边缘概率， "X的概率"<br>

### Bayes' theorem
$$\because \ \  p(X,Y) = p(Y,X) \\
p(X,Y) = p(Y\mid X)p(X) \\ p(Y ,X) = p(X \mid Y)p(Y) \\
\therefore \ \  p(Y\mid X) = \frac {p(X \mid Y)p(Y)}{p(X)}$$

使用`sum rule`得到$p(X) = \sum_Yp(X\mid Y)p(Y)$
原文：`We can view the denominator in Bayes' theorem as being the normalization constant required to ensure that the sum of the conditional probability on the lef-hand side of `$p(Y\mid X) = \frac {p(X \mid Y)p(Y)}{p(X)}$`over all values of Y equals one.`
